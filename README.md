# US-population-prediction-2050

Different researchers have done some research and analysis on the US population. Some focused on the labor market, some on poverty, some on housing, some on health and race. The focus of this paper will be on two different aspects. One will focus on the dispersion of African Americans throughout the United States of America, and the second one will be population prediction based on two census results, 2010 and 2020 census results. Population growth is becoming a reality for most countries globally, and the USA is not immune to that concern for poor and wealthy governments. According to the US census website (Census - Table Results, n.d.), the US population in 2010 was 308,745,538 and 334,735,155 in 2020. This paper will try to discover specific demographics and the population in general.

The model successfully predicted the population for 2025, approximately 347,729,964 and 360,724,772 for 2030. This type of prediction might not be one hundred percent accurate but can give an approximate figure so the concerned citizens and government officials would prepare accordingly.
